# 🎯 FINAL SOLUTION REPORT - Alternative Approaches

**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Time:** 12:01 PM  
**Status:** ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED WITH ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES**

## 🎯 Problem Analysis

**Issue:** "系統暫時無法使用" (System temporarily unavailable) kept recurring  
**Root Cause:** RAG API process was stopping unexpectedly  
**Challenge:** Traditional restart methods were not preventing the issue from recurring

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Persistent System Monitor** (`persistent_system_monitor.py`)
- **Purpose:** Continuously monitors all services
- **Features:**
  - Checks service health every 30 seconds
  - Auto-restarts failed services
  - Prevents cascading failures
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Restart cooldown periods

### 2. **Stable System Launcher** (`stable_system_launcher.py`)
- **Purpose:** Enhanced startup with retry mechanisms
- **Features:**
  - Multiple retry attempts for each service
  - Extended startup wait times
  - Comprehensive stability testing
  - Enhanced error handling
  - System stability verification
